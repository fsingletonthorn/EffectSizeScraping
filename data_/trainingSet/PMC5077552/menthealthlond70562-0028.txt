Prescription for Survival.
By Brock Chisholm. Columbia University
Press, New York 1957. 92 pp. $2.50. London: Oxford Univer'
sity Press. 20s.
This small book contains four lectures given by Dr. Chisholm at
Columbia University.
It cannot be recommended too highly. It will take about half
an hour to read, but many hours can well be spent in considering
the multitude of points made in the author's usual crystal clear yet
provocative manner.
