2 Results 2.1 Data preparation 2.1.1 Calculation of initial attentional bias index (AB-index) We computed attentional bias prior to ABM by subtracting mean Response Time (RT) of spider congruent image trials from the mean RT of spider incongruent image trials for each participant. To classify each participant's pre-training AB-index as reflecting either No AB, AB Towards or AB Away from spider cues we operationalized a conservative criterion value as outlined by  Zvielli et al. (2014a) bib49 bibr . Specifically, we defined an AB-index > 25 ms as the criterion for AB Towards spider images and an AB-index < −25 ms as the criterion for AB Away from spider images. No Bias was defined as AB-index > −25 ms  and  AB-index < 25 ms (i.e., an AB-index between −25 ms and +25 ms). sec2.1.1 2.1.2 Data reduction All trials with incorrect responses (2.9% of pre- and post ABM trials) and RT outliers (i.e. RTs <200 ms or >2000 ms (3.8% of pre and post-ABM trials)), were excluded. sec2.1.2 2.1.3 Calculation of attentional bias (AB) In accordance with the traditional computation of sample-level AB, we calculated the direction, magnitude and statistical significance of AB for spider-related images. Prior to the ABM session, mean RTs for the entire sample was just 4 ms faster on spider congruent (644 ms) relative to spider incongruent (648 ms) trials,  t  (126) – 1.1,  p  < .14, Cohen's d = .04, 2 fn2 fn  demonstrating no overall AB towards spider images. However, the RT difference between congruent and incongruent trials (AB-index) ranged from −105 ms up to +96 ms. There were no correlations between pre-ABM AB-index scores and scores on the SPQ (r = .004, p < .967), pre-ABM Stress Score (r = .103, p < .250) and pre-ABM Spider Fear Vulnerability ratings (r = .102, p < .254). To further explore whether AB prior to ABM might be associated in a non-linear (V-shaped) way around the zero point (i.e., no difference between spider congruent and incongruent trials) we conducted two separate correlations between SPQ scores and AB-index for those with a positive AB-index (>+ 1 ms) and those with a negative AB-index (<−1 ms). Neither correlation reached significance (r(71) = −.01 and r(56) = −.14, respectively). Interestingly, Trait Anxiety did correlate with the magnitude of both a positive AB-index (r(71) = .33, p < .01) and a negative AB-index (r(56) = −.26, p < .05). sec2.1.3 2.1.4 Classification of initial attentional bias groups Initial bias groups were determined based on the AB-index of >25 ms and <−25 ms criterion cut-offs at the pre-ABM session and this calculation was made after all testing had been completed when data was being prepared for analysis. Participants expressed the following patterns of attention bias in the pre-ABM session: a) 35% of participants (n = 44) demonstrated AB Towards spider-related images; b) 28% (n = 36) demonstrated AB Away from spider-related images; and c) 37% of participants (n = 47) demonstrated No Bias either towards, or away, from spider-related images.  Table 1 tbl1 table  shows that anxiety and depression-related variables did not differ among the three initial bias groups. sec2.1.4 2.1.5 Impact of ABM as a function of initial AB groups on change in attention bias The distribution of participants with different directions of initial bias did not differ across the ABM-active (AB Towards n = 27, AB Away n = 18, No Bias n = 21) and ABM-control (AB Towards n = 17, AB Away n = 18, No Bias n = 26) conditions, Chi-Squared = 2.61, p = .271. A pre-ABM bias index was computed by subtracting mean Response Time (RT) of spider congruent image trials from the mean RT of spider incongruent image trials for each participant for each initial bias group. Preliminary analyses of the post-ABM AB-index demonstrated that the pattern of results was similar for both old and new items on the post-ABM attentional probe task. Therefore, to simply analysis, post-ABM attentional bias scores for new and old items were combined since the pattern of results did not differ between these items. The bias scores on these items were combined to make a single post-ABM AB-index by subtracting mean RTs of (old and new) spider congruent image trials from the mean RTs of (old and new) spider incongruent image trials for each participant. A pre-to-post AB change score was also computed by subtracting post-ABM AB-index scores from pre-ABM AB-index scores to evaluate the magnitude of change in AB from before to after ABM. The AB indices for each Initial Bias group as a function of ABM before and after a single session of ABM (active or control) are shown in  Fig. 1 fig1 fig . A 2 (ABM Group: ABM-active, ABM-control) X 3 (Initial Bias: AB Towards, AB Away, No Bias) X 2 (Session: Pre-ABM, Post ABM) ANOVA was conducted with the AB-index as the dependent variable. There were main effects for ABM Group, F (1,121) = 16.7, p < .000, partial η 2  = .122, and Initial Bias, F(2,121) = 69.9, p < .000, partial η 2  = .536, as well as an ABM Group × Session interaction, F(1,121) = 31.0, p < .001, partial η 2  = .204, which was subsumed within a 3-way interaction between ABM Group, Session and Initial Bias, F(2, 121) = 3.07, p < .05, partial η 2  = .048. This interaction was confirmed by an ABM Group × Initial Bias interaction, F(2, 121) = 3.1, p < .05, partial η 2  = .048, using the pre-to-post AB change score as the dependent variable. To further explore the nature of this interaction two 1-way ANOVAs were computed with Initial Bias (AB Towards, AB Away, No Bias) as a between-subjects factor and the pre-to-post AB change score as the dependent variable for each ABM Group. There were main effects of Initial Bias for both ABM-active, F(2, 65) = 64.5, p < .001, partial η 2  = .672 and ABM-control groups, F((2, 60) = 37.6, p < .001, partial η 2  = .565). A series of planned t-tests revealed greater changes in AB in ABM-active relative to ABM-control conditions for the AB Toward (t(42) = 5,4, p < .001, Cohen's d = 7.5) and No Bias (t(45) = 2.5, p < .02, Cohen's d = 3.27) groups, with no difference in the AB Away (t(34) = 1.9, p < .07, Cohen's d = 2.96) group. Another way of looking at the data is to examine the number of participants from each Initial Bias group who moved to another bias group using the same criterion for the post-ABM AB-index (i.e., Bias Toward = > +25 ms; Bias Away = < −25 ms; No Bias = > −25 ms to < + 25 ms). These data are shown in  Fig. 2 fig2 fig  and demonstrate that the Bias Toward group had the largest number of participants shifting bias category following ABM-active training. sec2.1.5 sec2.1 2.2 Impact of ABM as a function of the different initial AB groups on emotional reactivity The impact of the initial bias on the degree of change in emotional reactivity to fear-relevant images was assessed by means of comparing performance on the ‘Stress Task’ and on the VAS ‘Spider Fear Vulnerability’ ratings when imagining being in the presence of a live spider for each of the ABM training groups (see  Tables 2 and 3 tbl2 tbl3 table  for mean scores). 2.2.1 Impact of ABM on change on the stress task A 2 (ABM Group: ABM-active, ABM-placebo) × 3 (Initial Bias: AB Towards, AB Away, no bias) × 2 (Session: Pre-ABM, Post ABM) ANOVA demonstrated main effects of ABM Group, F(1, 121) = 26.2, p < .00, partial η 2  = .178, and Session, F(1, 121) = 50.3, p < .000, partial η 2  = .294. There was an ABM Group × Session interaction, F(1, 121) = 43.9, p < .00, partial η 2  = .266, which was not further qualified by the type of Initial Bias for the ‘Stress Task’. This was confirmed by analysis of the pre-to-post Stress Task change score as the dependent variable, F((2, 60) = 37.6, p < .001, partial η 2  = .565). As shown in  Table 2 tbl2 table , the level of stress decreased following ABM-active training but not following ABM-control for all Initial Bias groups. 2.2.1.1 Impact of ABM on change in spider fear vulnerability A 2 (ABM Group: ABM-active, ABM-placebo) × 3 (Initial Bias: AB Towards, AB Away, no bias) × 2 (Session: Pre-ABM, Post ABM) ANOVA demonstrated main effects of ABM Group, F(1, 121) = 16.1, p < .00, partial η 2  = .118, and Initial Bias F(2,121) = 3.9, p < .024, partial η 2  = .060. There was an ABM Group × Session interaction, F(1, 121) = 6.3, p < .000, partial η 2  = .049, which was further qualified by the type of Initial Bias, F(2,121) = 15.1, p < .000, partial η 2  = .200. This interaction was confirmed by an ABM Group × Initial Bias interaction, F(2, 121) = 15.1, p < .001, partial η 2  = .200, using the pre-to-post change in spider fear vulnerability score as the dependent variable. See  Table 3 tbl3 table  for detailed statistics. To further explore the nature of this interaction two 1-way ANOVAs were computed with Initial Bias (AB towards, AB away, No Bias) as a between-subjects factor and the pre-to-post change in fear vulnerability scores as the dependent variable for each ABM Group. There was a main effect of Initial Bias for the ABM-active, F(2, 65) = 16.9, p < .001, partial η 2  = .349 but not the ABM-control group, F((2, 60) = 2.2, p < .122, partial η 2  = .015). A series of planned t-tests revealed a greater reduction in fear vulnerability in the ABM-active relative to ABM-control condition for the AB Toward (t(42) = −5.1, p < .001, Cohen's d = −1.63) group. However, for the AB Away group there was a significant  increase  in fear vulnerability following active relative to control ABM, (t(34) = 3.5, p < .001, Cohen's d = 1.19), group with no difference in the No Bias (t(45) < 1, p < .48, Cohen's d = −.235) group. sec2.2.1.1 sec2.2.1 2.2.2 Predictors of post ABM stress and spider fear vulnerability Two regression analyses were computed in order to determine whether ABM Group; SPQ scores, and the pre-to-post AB change predicted the degree of change in Stress and Spider Fear Vulnerability ratings following a single session of ABM. These three variables were entered into the regression in a fixed order as predictors. For post-ABM Stress ratings as the outcome measure, the overall regression equation was significant, Adjusted R 2  = .251, R 2  Change = .268, F Change (3, 123) = 15.0, p < .001. The only predictor that was significantly related to Stress ratings was ABM Group (B = 14.9, Beta = .51, p < .001, partial correlation = .484). Partial correlations between the outcome measure (change in stress ratings) and SPQ scores (r = .024) and bias change scores (r = −.032) were not significant. A similar regression was run with post-ABM Spider Fear Vulnerability ratings as the outcome variable with the same three predictors. The overall regression equation was significant, Adjusted R 2  = .137, R 2  Change = .157, F Change (3, 123) = 7.6, p < .001. The only predictor that was significantly related to change in Fear Vulnerability was change in bias (B = −.079, Beta = −.310, p < .001, partial correlation = −.301). Partial correlations between the outcome measure (change in fear vulnerability ratings) and SPQ scores (r = −.14) and ABM group (r = .134) were not significant. sec2.2.2 sec2.2 results sec2
