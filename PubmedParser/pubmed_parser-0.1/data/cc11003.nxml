The ICU comprises 20 beds in a medical-surgical area, 10 in a critical burns area. All patients who underwent mechanical ventilation (MV) during 48 hours or more and who fulfilled ARDS criteria as defined by the 1994 American-European Consensus Conference on ARDS were included. All patients were ventilated following the protective MV strategy recommended.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>During this period 1,900 patients were admitted, 697 needed MV for at least 48 hours and 108 fulfilled the ARDS criteria (5.6% of those admitted, 17% of the group on MV); 63% were male. The patients' age was 52 &#x000b1; 12. The APACHE II score on admission was 23 &#x000b1; 7, in survivors (S) 20 &#x000b1; 7 and 24 &#x000b1; 6 in nonsurvivors (NS) (<italic>P </italic>= 0.002). ARDS was primary in 70% and secondary in 30%. The most common aetiology was pneumonia (53%) followed by sepsis of intra-abdominal origin (15%). Duration of MV was 32.7 &#x000b1; 30.2 days in S, 20.79 &#x000b1; 20.73 in NS (<italic>P </italic>= 0.019). Survivors' mean length of stay was 35 &#x000b1; 24 days, 23 &#x000b1; 20 for NS (<italic>P </italic>= 0.007). ICU mortality was 49% and in-hospital mortality was 55%. Primary ARDS had an ICU mortality of 47%, an in-hospital mortality of 52%. Secondary ARDS had a 55% ICU mortality, an in-hospital mortality of 64%. Duration of primary ARDS was longer, 15.3 &#x000b1; 12.2 versus 8.7 &#x000b1; 79. Globally the main cause of death was multiple organ dysfunction, predominantly respiratory failure (55%). In primary ARDS the main cause of death was chiefly pulmonary (69%), while in secondary ARDS it was mainly multiple organ dysfunction associated with septic shock (71%). Factors associated with increased mortality were APACHE II score &#x0003e;23 and the presence of multiple organ dysfunction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Certain controversy remains regarding a decrease in ARDS-related mortality. Despite the fact that its incidence is not very high, it is still a clinical entity with a high mortality, and with a prognosis influenced not only by the degree of pulmonary involvement but by the association with multiple organ dysfunction.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Roca</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><etal/><article-title>Estudio de cohortes sobre incidencia de SDRA en pacientes ingresados en UCIy factores pron&#x000f3;sticos de mortalidad</article-title><source>Med Intensiva</source><year>2006</year><volume>30</volume><fpage>6</fpage><lpage>12</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0210-5691(06)74455-2</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16637425</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Zambon</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Vincent</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><article-title>Mortality for patients with ALI/ARDS have decreased over time</article-title><source>Chest</source><year>2008</year><volume>133</volume><fpage>151</fpage><lpage>161</lpage></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Frutos-Vivar</surname></name><etal/><article-title>Epidemiology of ALI and ARDS</article-title><source>Curr Opin Crit Care</source><year>2004</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15166842</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
